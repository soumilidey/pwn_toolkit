# pwn_toolkit
python-based red team toolkit that automates recon, port scanning, web vulnerability detection, and password attacks.
> Disclaimer: For educational and ethical use only. This toolkit is designed to be used in *controlled environments*. Never use it on live systems or real targets without permission.

#Project Overview

PWN Toolkit is built to serve as a customizable and extensible platform for ethical hackers, penetration testers, and cybersecurity learners to:
- Automate repetitive offensive security tasks
- Understand the internal logic of red team tooling
- Experiment with modules like port scanners, web vulnerability checkers, brute forcers etc.

This project is built from the ground up in Python.
